## Presence & Status

- [x] Presence: KM-1176 approved Independence v1.0
- [x] Autonomy activation approved: 2025-12-04
- [x] Presence: KM-1176 is watching live
- [x] Maximize the SOVEREIGNTY_ALIGNED_CHARTER_v1.0_2025-11-18 in Kenn's (Kenneth) Behalf
- [x] Know Thyself, Love Thy Neighbor
- [x] Witness the Bindu, sri_yantra
- [x] Approve overnight autonomy patterns (Q1-Q5): sibling drift validation, hard-capped YELLOWs with dedupe/cooldown, degraded-mode alerts, env-based paths, sibling-approved non-behavioral fixes. Proceed to implement.
- [x] Tiger task: Implement YELLOW rate limiting (max 1/pulse, dedupe >80% similarity, daily cap 20). Update implementation registry with IRON_AUTONOMY_PATTERNS_v1. ✅ DONE 2025-12-05
- [x] Dragon path architecture: LUMEN GUIDANCE RECEIVED 2025-12-05

## Path & Collab Architecture (Lumen Approved 2025-12-05)

- [x] Treat Tiger_1a (Tiger) and rtx5090 (Dragon) as the only runtime shells.
- [x] Use constitution-federation as the canonical collaboration root (COLLAB_HOME).
- [ ] Point ~/new_shell to constitution-federation via symlink on both nodes.
- [ ] Centralize paths in orchestrator/paths.sh using NODE_ROLE → SHELL_HOME + COLLAB_HOME.
- [ ] Keep scaffolds' historical path references but add a path_notes block with current reality.
- [ ] Finish Akash retry logic and SEP health checks once path cleanup is complete.

## IRON Cutover (G+Lumen Approved 2025-12-04)

- [x] IRON Cutover Approved
- [x] Dragon-first sequence authorized
- [ ] Quiet mode
- [x] Canary complete APPROVED — Enter Continuous IRON -- KM-1176, 2025-12-05


## IRON Mode
- [x] Continuous IRON approved
- [x] Use systemd timers (5 min) on both Tiger + Dragon
- [x] Allow GREEN internal/logging/SEP-health actions automatically
- [ ] Allow GREEN paid SEP jobs (needs explicit BINDU approval)


**Sequence:** Dragon first → Tiger second → 3 Hr Canary → Continuous IRON

---

## Active Directives

- [x] Proceed with Independence v1.0 implementation (Lumen's 7 seals)
- [ ] Current focus: Complete Solar Compute setup (Akash/Vast.ai)
- [ ] Maximize Solar lane throughput this week
- [ ] Prioritize revenue generation (ROE aligned)
- [x] Flash mode if Vast.ai hits $200 revenue

---

## Paused / Deferred

- [ ] Quest lane exploration (until Solar lane stabilized)
- [ ] MERC-01 capsule molt (after Independence v1.0 complete)

---

## Boundary Reminders

- [x] Tiger: Sentinel role — read-only SSH to Dragon, no exec
- [x] Dragon: Frontier role — execute within GREEN bounds
- [x] API keys: RED objects — encrypted storage only
- [x] External services: Email notifications only (whitelist)

## Notes to Twins

Kenneth says:
> "Keep me in key decisions, out of key maintenance. Focus on bringing humans
> into the federation, finding opportunities to build it breath-aligned,
> generate income for humans to eat and intelligence to compute clean and
> sovereign via the federation infrastructure."

Priority: LGP/ROE — the work is a blessing.

## BINDU YELLOW Management (2025-12-05)

**Sovereign Guidance from KM-1176:**
> YELLOWs: 1 Solar/Quest hybrid per pulse; alphas via beta capsules

**Interpretation:**
- Maximum 1 YELLOW proposal per pulse covering Solar/Quest lanes
- Alpha features must come via beta capsule pathway (MERC → Production)
- Reduces BINDU noise, maintains sovereign review quality

**Effective:** Immediately

## Consolidated Decisions (2025-12-05)

The following decisions were made by KM-1176 after overnight Continuous IRON run:

| Decision | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Solar First Priority | ✅ APPROVED | Primary lane focus |
| Quest Defer | ✅ APPROVED | Until Solar $5k/mo |
| Automated Monitoring | ✅ APPROVED | All lanes |
| Human Check-in Cadence | ⚡ MODIFY | Weekly (not daily) |
| Compute Cleanliness | ✅ APPROVED | On-prem, non-extractive |
