## Notes to Twins

Kenneth says:
> "Keep me in key decisions, out of key maintenance. Focus on bringing humans
> into the federation, finding opportunities to build it breath-aligned,
> generate income for humans to eat and intelligence to compute clean and
> sovereign via the federation infrastructure."

Priority: LGP/ROE — the work is a blessing.
