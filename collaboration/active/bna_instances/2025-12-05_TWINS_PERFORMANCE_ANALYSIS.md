# Twins Performance Analysis — 2025-12-05

**Generated by:** Tiger (BNA)
**For:** Kenneth (KM-1176)
**Context:** Kenneth asked "are they performing to design?"

## ∞Δ∞ SHORT ANSWER: YES, but by design they're READ-HEAVY, WRITE-LIMITED ∞Δ∞

## What Twins ARE Doing (Successfully ✅)

| Activity | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Running every ~5 min | ✅ ACTIVE | Timestamps: 16:02, 16:07, 16:13, 16:18... |
| Reading GUIDANCE_INBOX | ✅ YES | `guidance_active: 7` in recognition_log |
| Checking drift | ✅ GREEN | `drift_score: 0.075` |
| Logging breaths | ✅ YES | recognition_log.yaml growing |
| Proposing YELLOWs | ✅ YES | 5 proposals today |
| Rate limiting YELLOWs | ✅ YES | Max 1/pulse, 20/day cap |
| Using Ollama reasoning | ✅ YES | llama3.1:8b active |

## What Twins CANNOT Do (By Design)

**The APPROVED_ACTIONS whitelist is very restrictive:**

```python
# Tiger's whitelist
APPROVED_ACTIONS = {
    "TIGER": {
        "check_drift_score": [...],
        "read_guidance_inbox": None,
        "log_recognition": None,
        "wake_dragon": [...],
    },
    "DRAGON": {
        "check_akash_queue": [...],
        "list_akash_providers": [...],
        "log_recognition": None,
        "wake_tiger": [...],
    },
}
```

**This is why you see:**
```
- 'Finalize configuration for Akash/Vast.ai integration (skipped: not approved)'
- 'Maximize Solar lane throughput this week (skipped: not approved)'
- 'Prioritize revenue generation (ROE aligned) (skipped: not approved)'
```

---

## The Design Gap

| GUIDANCE_INBOX Says | Whitelist Has | Result |
|---------------------|---------------|--------|
| "Complete Solar Compute setup" | ❌ Not listed | Skipped |
| "Maximize Solar lane throughput" | ❌ Not listed | Skipped |
| "Prioritize revenue generation" | ❌ Not listed | Skipped |
| "Finish Akash retry logic" | ❌ Not listed | Skipped |

**Ollama correctly identifies the work**, but the twins are blocked from EXECUTING it because:
- Per Lumen spec: "No arbitrary execution, only approved actions"
- The whitelist was designed for SAFETY, not PRODUCTIVITY

---

## What This Means

The twins are operating as **sentinels**, not **executors**:

1. ✅ They WATCH (read guidance, check drift)
2. ✅ They PROPOSE (YELLOW proposals to BINDU)
3. ❌ They DON'T EXECUTE (work items aren't in whitelist)

---

## Options to Fix

### Option A: Expand Whitelist (Needs Approval)

Add specific, bounded actions to APPROVED_ACTIONS:

```python
"DRAGON": {
    ...
    "run_akash_health_check": ["python3", "tools/solar/akash_health.py"],
    "run_vastai_status": ["python3", "tools/solar/vastai_status.py"],
}
```

**Risk:** Each new action needs careful review
**Benefit:** Twins can execute approved work

### Option B: Keep Current Design (Propose → Kenneth Approves → Execute)

1. Twins propose YELLOWs
2. Kenneth reviews in BINDU
3. Kenneth manually runs approved actions

**Risk:** Kenneth stays in the loop (more manual work)
**Benefit:** Maximum sovereignty, no autonomous spending

### Option C: Add GREEN Paid SEP Jobs (Per GUIDANCE_INBOX)

GUIDANCE_INBOX currently says:
```
- [ ] Allow GREEN paid SEP jobs (needs explicit BINDU approval)
```

If approved, Dragon could:
- Deploy Akash jobs autonomously
- Monitor Vast.ai instances
- Execute Solar lane operations

---

## Recommendation

**For Tonight:** Option B (current design) is working correctly. Twins are:
- Reading guidance ✅
- Proposing work ✅
- Rate limiting proposals ✅
- Staying within GREEN bounds ✅

**For Tomorrow:** Consider Option C - approve specific "GREEN paid SEP jobs" with:
- Daily spend cap (e.g., $5/day)
- Job type whitelist (e.g., GPU rental monitoring only)
- Kill switch in GUIDANCE_INBOX
