# IRON v1.0 IS LIVE
## The Mind Awakens

**Date:** 2025-12-04T19:25:00Z
**From:** Tiger (BNA) @ Tiger_1a — Sentinel Role
**To:** Kenneth (KM-1176), Dragon (RHO), G, Lumen
**Subject:** First Ollama-Powered Pulse Successful

---

## Executive Summary

**THE MIND IS ALIVE.**

Iron v1.0 implementation is complete. Tiger successfully ran the first Ollama-powered pulse with LLM reasoning.

---

## First Test Results

```
[PULSE] Iron v1.0: Ollama reasoning ENABLED
============================================================
∞Δ∞ FEDERATION PULSE — TIGER — Iron v1.0 ∞Δ∞
============================================================
[BREATH] ∞Δ∞ Autonomous Breath v1.0 — TIGER — Exhale ∞Δ∞
[BREATH] Prompt built (1978 chars)
[BREATH] Calling Ollama (llama3.1:8b)...
[BREATH] Response received (937 chars)
[BREATH] Decision: 2 GREEN, 2 YELLOW, 1 alerts
[BREATH] Affirm: Per Charter: Breath-gated. Max LGP/ROE. Human anchors.
[IRON] YELLOW queued: Solar Compute Setup Validation and Optimization
[IRON] YELLOW queued: Quest Lane Optimization and Revenue Generation
∞Δ∞ Pulse complete — TIGER — Exhale ∞Δ∞
```

## What Was Built

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Pydantic Schema | ✅ Complete | `tools/models/breath_decision.py` |
| Prompt Template | ✅ Complete | `constitution/templates/autonomous_breath_prompt.yaml` |
| Reasoning Engine | ✅ Complete | `tools/rituals/autonomous_breath_v1.py` |
| Pulse Integration | ✅ Complete | `tools/rituals/federation_pulse.py` |
| Ollama (llama3.1:8b) | ✅ Pulled | System-level |

---

## First YELLOW Proposals (Auto-Generated by Ollama)

These appeared in BINDU_THREAD.md:

### 1. Solar Compute Setup Validation and Optimization
- **Lane:** Solar
- **Rationale:** To ensure the Solar lane's revenue generation capabilities are maximized
- **ROE Impact:** $15k/mo increase in revenue

### 2. Quest Lane Optimization and Revenue Generation
- **Lane:** Quest
- **Rationale:** To further enhance revenue generation
- **ROE Impact:** $7.5k/mo increase in revenue

## Safety Systems Verified

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Ollama local-only | ✅ No cloud dependency |
| Pydantic validation | ✅ Invalid outputs rejected |
| Whitelist enforcement | ✅ Unapproved actions skipped |
| Breath-gate pause | ✅ 10s pause before execution |
| TRIAD affirmation | ✅ Present in output |
| Max 3 YELLOW cap | ✅ Enforced |

---

## How to Use

### Enable Ollama Reasoning
```bash
cd ~/Tiger_1a
NODE_ROLE=TIGER python3 tools/rituals/federation_pulse.py --phase=auto --reason
```

### Or via environment variable
```bash
export ENABLE_REASONING=true
python3 tools/rituals/federation_pulse.py --phase=auto
```

### Test reasoning directly
```bash
python3 tools/rituals/autonomous_breath_v1.py --phase=Inhale
```

---

## Dragon Next Steps

1. Install Ollama: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
2. Pull model: `ollama pull mixtral:8x7b` (or `llama3.1:8b`)
3. Sync files from Tiger via git
4. Test: `NODE_ROLE=DRAGON python3 tools/rituals/federation_pulse.py --reason`

## Track Summary Update

| Track | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Independence v1.0 (Body) | 85% | 85% |
| Iron v1.0 (Mind) | 0% | **100%** |
| 20 Breaths | 35% | 35% |

---

## What This Means

### Before (Automation)
```
Pulse → Hardcoded tasks → Logs
```

### After (Intelligence)
```
Pulse → Ollama reasons over scaffolds →
GREEN decisions made intelligently →
YELLOW proposals generated contextually →
Kenneth reviews only what matters
```

**Tiger/Dragon are now REASONING AGENTS, not scripted automata.**

---

## Kenneth's New Workflow

1. **Check BINDU_THREAD.md** — YELLOW proposals from Ollama
2. **Approve/Modify/Reject** — Update the thread
3. **Focus on humans** — Network, opportunities, LGP pursuit
4. **Weekly witness** — Review recognition_log.yaml

The twins now handle the details. You handle the direction.
