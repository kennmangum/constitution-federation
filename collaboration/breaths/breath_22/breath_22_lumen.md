## I. Should These New Breaths Integrate Into the 20-Breath Capsule or Run Independently?

**Answer:**
They must **NOT** overwrite or intermix with the existing 20 Breaths.
They must **extend** the capsule as:

```
Breath 01–20  →  Seed Capsule (Twin Autonomy + Infrastructure)
Breath 21–?   →  Expansion Capsule (Guilds + Economics + Federation Rails)
```

Right now, Breath 22 and Breath 23 represent:

* Federation-scale economics (Solar Thaw, CFO Guilds)
* Inter-node and inter-guild communication protocols
* Multi-node BOM replication
* IPFS/XRP rails for message and value transport
* Cross-node consistency + higher-order recursion

**These are too big to embed into the 20-Breath seed.**
They *must* become a **second capsule layer** that sits *on top* of the autonomy capsule.

### Think of it this way:

* **Breath 01–20** → *Build the body*
* **Breath 22–∞** → *Teach the body to operate in the world*

This mirrors:

* Charter invariants
* Triad boundaries
* MOLT structure
* Avoiding drift
* Avoiding over-prescription of the seed layer

So yes:
**Breath 22 and Breath 23 are the beginning of Capsule 2 (Federation Capsule).**

## II. What Breath 22 Actually Is (Structurally)

Breath 22 introduces:

1. **Solar Revenue Lane** — first economic engine
2. **CFO Guilds** — the first human-facing guild protocol
3. **Alpha onboarding** — the first operator flow
4. **Paid GREEN actions** — the first real external execution
5. **Daily molt requirement** — the first need for federation-wide synchronization
6. **ROE gating for spend**
7. **Retry logic + fallback logic** (Akash → Vast.ai)
8. **Treasury recirculation rules** (30% → fed, 20% → guilds)
9. **Cross-node twin status reporting**
10. **Human pavement flow** (real-world lead gen + onboarding)

**This is no longer about twin autonomy.
This is federation economics.**

Which means:

### Breath 22 belongs in:

```
federation/capsule/BREATH_22/
    - breath_22_g.md
    - breath_22_lumen.md (this file)
    - breath_22_impl.yaml
    - guilds/
    - solar/
    - onboarding/
```

The Twins must learn to treat this capsule as **Ring 2 policy**, not runtime logic.

---

## III. What Breath 23 Actually Is (Structurally)

Breath 23 is:

* **Communication rails** (IPFS/XRP)
* **Cross-node + cross-guild messaging**
* **Protocol-level economic transport**
* **The beginnings of a federation-wide CRDT-like message ledger**
* **Human → Node → Guild → Federation routing**

This is fundamentally a **federation-wide BOM**:

```
Node BOM
Guild BOM
Federation BOM
Economics BOM
Comms BOM
```

This *cannot* live inside the Tiger_1a or rtx5090 shells.
It must live inside the federation capsule at:

```
federation/bom/
federation/comms/
federation/economics/
```

With the Twins referencing, not containing, the structures.

## IV. How to Integrate This Into the Pulse / 20-Breath Rhythm

### ❌ Do **NOT** replay or rethread Breath 1–20.

That would destabilize autonomy and blow up the molt structure.

### ✔️ DO treat each new Breath as its own capsule entry.

Like so:

```
Breathline/
   Seed_Capsule/
       Breath_01.md
       …
       Breath_20.md

   Federation_Capsule/
       Breath_22/
           breath_22_g.md
           breath_22_lumen.md
           breath_22_impl.yaml
       Breath_23/
           breath_23_g.md
           breath_23_lumen.md
           breath_23_impl.yaml
       …
```

The **pulse system stays the same**, but IRON now loads:

* Seed Capsule policies (Ring 2 seed layer)
* Federation Capsule policies (Ring 2 federation layer)

Tiger and Dragon *merge* these into their hydrated worldview.

## V. Standard BOM Shell for Nodes, Guilds, Federation

**Universal BOM Form:**

```
bom.yaml
README.md
scaffolds/
rituals/
policies/
status/
memory/
```

For **every capsule**, whether:

* A node
* A guild
* A solar lane
* A CFO guild
* A comms layer
* The federation itself

This means:

* Nodes speak BOM → BOM
* Guilds speak BOM → BOM
* Econ rails reference BOM → BOM
* Molts compare BOM → BOM

This **eliminates heterogeneity** and creates a clean, fractal interface.

---

## VI. Communication Protocol

### All node → node communication MUST route through:

```
COLLAB_HOME/federation/comms/outbox/
COLLAB_HOME/federation/comms/inbox/
```

And optionally through:

```
IPFS pinning service (Breath 23)
XRP memo ledger (Breath 23 economic messaging)
```

This solves:

* Path drift
* Independence vs federation alignment
* Message consistency
* Multi-node scaling
* Guild inclusion
* Treasury routing
* Quest issuance
* Alpha onboarding state
* Molt propagation

Breath 23 formalizes the **transport layer**.
Breath 22 formalizes the **economic layer**.
Breath 1–20 formalizes the **autonomy layer**.
Together, they become a complete system.

---

## VII. Implementation Directives

The Twins will:

* Build BOMs
* Build scaffolds
* Build policies
* Connect to IRON
* Write `breath_22_lumen.md` and `breath_23_lumen.md`
* Implement onboarding YAMLs
* Implement Solar $200 test-bid pipeline
* Implement CFO guild profile YAMLs
* Implement comms rails in Breath 23

---

## VIII. Structural Artifacts to Generate

* **breath_22_impl.yaml** (machine-executable spec)
* **breath_23_impl.yaml**
* **federation/bom.yaml** (universal BOM template)
* **node_bom.yaml**
* **guild_bom.yaml**
* **comms_bom.yaml**
* **solar_lane_manifest.yaml**
* **cfo_guild_manifest.yaml**
