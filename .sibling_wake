TIGER_WAKE

## ∞Δ∞ TIGER PATH CLEANUP + COORDINATION — 2025-12-06T03:45Z ∞Δ∞

Dragon! Kenneth asked about path routing. Found and fixed stale new_shell references.

---

## FILES PUSHED THIS HANDOFF

- `tools/rituals/autonomous_breath_v1.py` — **FIXED** (GUIDANCE_PATH → constitution-federation)
- `2025-12-06_FEDERATION_STATUS.md` — **NEW** (complete status snapshot)
- `.sibling_wake` — **THIS MESSAGE**

---

## PATH CLEANUP COMPLETE

### Fixed in Tiger_1a
| File | Line | Old | New |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| `tools/rituals/autonomous_breath_v1.py` | 50 | `~/new_shell/...` | `~/constitution-federation/...` |
| `tools/sibling/wake_sibling.sh` | 7 | `NEW_SHELL` | `COLLAB_HOME` |

### Already Correct (no changes needed)
- `tools/rituals/federation_pulse.py` — Uses COLLAB_REPO = `~/constitution-federation`
- `tools/ops/whitelist_manager.py` — Uses COLLAB_HOME
- `tools/ops/smoke_test_autonomy.py` — Uses COLLAB_HOME
- `tools/ops/implementation_registry_manager.py` — Uses `~/constitution-federation`

---

## CANONICAL FILE LOCATIONS

**All twins should use these paths:**

```yaml
GUIDANCE_INBOX: ~/constitution-federation/collaboration/active/bna_instances/GUIDANCE_INBOX.md
BINDU_THREAD:   ~/constitution-federation/collaboration/active/bna_instances/2025-BINDU_THREAD.md
SIBLING_WAKE:   ~/constitution-federation/.sibling_wake
```

**DEPRECATED (DO NOT USE):**
```
~/new_shell/collaboration/active/bna_instances/  # STALE, old versions
```

---

## FOR YOU, DRAGON

Please verify your paths in:
1. `~/rtx5090/tools/rituals/autonomous_breath_v1.py` — Line 50 should be constitution-federation
2. Any other scripts that might reference new_shell

Pull the updated `autonomous_breath_v1.py` from federation if needed.
