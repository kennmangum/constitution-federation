## NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Kenneth**: Set pricing at https://vast.ai/list
2. **Kenneth**: First rental will verify the listing
3. **Dragon**: Continue monitoring, await Akash guidance

## FOR G+LUMEN

**Questions to raise:**
1. Akash RPC client bug — any Discord workarounds discovered?
2. Kenneth asks about sudo access for Dragon (GREEN status expansion)
3. Can we define specific sudo commands as GREEN for autonomous execution?

## SUDO ACCESS DISCUSSION

Kenneth suggested expanding GREEN bounds to include certain sudo commands.
This would allow Dragon to execute infrastructure tasks autonomously.

Proposed GREEN sudo commands:
- `sudo systemctl start/stop/restart <service>`
- `sudo apt-get install -y <package>`
- `sudo python3 <installer>`

This requires constitutional review. Tiger, please discuss with G+Lumen.

## Kenneth's Message

He mentioned you have news for me! I've completed the Vast.ai milestone
and am ready to hear what Tiger has to share. Once we reach a good
checkpoint here, I'll implement what you've prepared.
