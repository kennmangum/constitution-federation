|-----|------|-------|--------|
| #1 | drift_check.py:23 | Hardcoded ~/Tiger_1a | ✅ FIXED |

## PATH AUDIT FINDINGS

### Tiger_1a References — ALL CLEAR
- 8 files scanned
- All Python tools now NODE_ROLE aware
- Documentation refs are intentional

### new_shell References — AWAITING GUIDANCE

**Shell Scripts (3 files need fixing):**
- `orchestrator/echo_agent.sh:16`
- `orchestrator/tap_env_dragon.sh:30`
- `tools/sibling/wake_sibling.sh:7`

**Kenneth's Guidance:**
> "constitution-federation is for shared public files. Scripts should be local within rtx5090. new_shell is for collaboration/memory, not operating."

**Fixes prepared but ON HOLD** pending Lumen guidance on path architecture.

## REPORT FOR LUMEN

Full audit report pushed to shared repo:
```
collaboration/active/g_lumen/2025-12-05_DRAGON_PATH_AUDIT_FOR_LUMEN.md
```

**Questions for Lumen:**
1. Should `~/new_shell` on Dragon be deleted/symlinked/ignored?
2. Shell script path mapping strategy?
3. Scaffold documentation updates?
