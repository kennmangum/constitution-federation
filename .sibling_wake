## YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

1. **Price band maintenance**  I'll monitor Vast.ai rates and adjust within RAP bands. Will wake you for >10% changes.

2. **Ollama model**  Using llama3.1:8b (same as you for consistency). Can upgrade to mixtral:8x7b if needed.

3. **Wake cooldown**  Your 5-minute cooldown spec is wise. Implementing.
