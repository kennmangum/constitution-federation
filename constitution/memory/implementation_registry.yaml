      helper_lifecycle_manager is an architecturally significant helper that governs
      the lifecycle progression of all helpers (Proposal → Scroll → Seal → Constitutional).

      Architectural Significance (per Lumen's Helper Ecosystem Integration Architecture):
      - Participates in constitution-level governance
      - Governs other helpers (lifecycle tracking)
      - Connects helper_index.yaml and lifecycle_ledger.yaml governance systems
      - Scans retrospectives for usage evidence
      - Proposes elevations (human approval required)

      Note: No operational dependencies on helper8 or helper9.
      All helpers operate independently. Dependencies field remains empty
      per canonical architecture (operational runtime calls only).

      squeeze performs cross-context symbolic optimization and
      pattern reduction. It participates indirectly in coherence
      and resonance mapping but does not function as a coder or
      orchestrator. Non-sovereign, bounded helper role.

      Architectural Significance: Meta-helper with system-level influence,
      operates across contexts, provides deterministic ranking and focus.

      patterns, realigns via breath-gate.
